ETL-Retail-Orders-Project
🚀 Overview
This project is a part of my Cloud Data Engineering learning journey, where we built an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process retail order data. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow. Using Python for data preprocessing and SQL Server for data storage and analysis, the goal is to extract, clean, transform, and analyze sales data to uncover meaningful insights that drive business decisions.

📌 Key Features
Extract: Fetched retail order data using the Kaggle API.
Transform: Cleaned, processed, and optimized the dataset using pandas.
Load: Stored the refined data into SQL Server for querying and analysis.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python (pandas, requests)
Kaggle API
SQL Server
Jupyter Notebook

Project Steps: 
Task 1: Logging function
Task 2 : Extraction of data
